On the 1<sup>st</sup> November we welcomed 10 teams from 5 schools, 1 club and 1 independent team at our kickoff event for RoboCon 2026.  
<br>
The day started with a presentation from 4 of our students about this year's competition 'Tributes to the Fallen'.
<br>

In this game, the arena is split into 4 Sectors (Areas), each owned by a Tribute (a RoboCon robot) with its own Sector. Each tribute needs to collect supply crates and place them in their Sector or their home. Every so often, supply drops will be sent down from Cornucopia (above the neutral zone); collect them and return to your Sector. You will score points for any crate you bring back to your Sector, or to your home for extra points. Multiply the points of specific crates by stacking them.
<br>

After the introduction of our thrilling new competition, students then got to complete a set of mini challenges.
<br>

We wish this year's teams the best of luck with their robot building! Don’t forget, we offer plenty of ongoing support available throughout the competition. This is available over email, video calls, in-person visits to your school, or drop-in visits to Hills Road Sixth Form College on a Saturday (pre-arrangement necessary). Email us at [robotics@hrsfc.ac.uk](mailto:robotics@hrsfc.ac.uk) for any help, support or queries.
