After the introduction of our exciting new competition, students then got to complete a set of mini challenges. These challenges are a great way to explore the capabilities of our new version 3 BrainBoxes.    
<br>
We wish this year's teams the best of luck with their robot building! Don’t forget, we offer plenty of ongoing support available throughout the competition. This is available over email, video calls, in-person visits to your school, or drop-in visits to Hills Road Sixth Form College on a Saturday (pre-arrangement necessary). Email us at [robotics@hrsfc.ac.uk](mailto:robotics@hrsfc.ac.uk) for any help, support or queries.
