Today we welcomed {number} teams from {number} schools at our kickoff event for RoboCon 2026.  
<br>
The day started with a presentation from {number} of our students about this year's competition 'The Hunger Games'.
<br>

In this game, the arena is split into 4 areas, each owned by a tribute (a RoboCon robot) with its own district. Each tribute needs to collect supply crates and place them in their district or their home. Every so often, the sponsors will send down supply drops from Cornucopia (above the neutral zone), collect them and return to your district. You will score points for any crate you bring back to your district (or to your home for extra points). Multiply your points by stacking your crates.
<br>

After the introduction of our exciting new competition, students then got to complete a set of mini challenges.
<br>

We wish this year's teams the best of luck with their robot building! Don’t forget, we offer plenty of ongoing support available throughout the competition. This is available over email, video calls, in-person visits to your school, or drop-in visits to Hills Road Sixth Form College on a Saturday (pre-arrangement necessary). Email us at [robotics@hrsfc.ac.uk](mailto:robotics@hrsfc.ac.uk) for any help, support or queries.
