We are pleased to announce that we will be running RoboCon 2019. A competition for students in years 9-11. It will be free to enter, there will be a starter kit to get you going and we will provide support. If you are interested in taking part email us at: [robotics@hrsfc.ac.uk](mailto:robotics@hrsfc.ac.uk). 

Currently we are drawing up plans so watch this space for more information in the coming weeks.

Till then,

Don't Walk. Do The Robot!
